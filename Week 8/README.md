## Week 8 AML

The code of this week can be found within the interactive python notebook: BM.ipynb

All plots (and some more..) can be found within PLOTS. Note that not all of these plots are used within the report or actually from the code that we ultimately used.

Lastle PDFS contains the excercise as well as the paper we cited in the report by Kappen en Rodriquez
